    <br>
    <div class="hero-text"> The limited CD version isn’t just a standard press — it’s designed as a piece of art:<br>
      <br>
      Not That Far Away Up to Stock originally captured listeners with its richly textured arrangements and reflective lyrical journey. Tracks like “Stairs You Have To Climb” and “Shards of Glass” helped establish Midheaven as a band capable of balancing raw emotion with refined musicianship. <br>
      <br>
